 The Recipie:
To create the crumbs, you can either break up the cupcake by hand or use a cheese grater. I find that using the grater gives you a more consistent crumb for decorating.
Pipe a thick layer of cream cheese frosting between each layer. Cover the cake in frosting.
Use a bench scraper and offset spatula to smooth out the cake. Transfer to the fridge to chill for about 10 minutes or until the frosting is a bit set. If you’re in a warm climate, let your cake chill for even longer!
Using your hand, scoop crumbs onto the side and top of the cake until it’s completely covered.
Arrange the flowers on top of the cake. Pipe in leaves using the green buttercream.
